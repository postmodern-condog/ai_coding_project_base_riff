# Verification Credentials
# ========================
# Copy this file to .env.verification and fill in values.
# IMPORTANT: Add .env.verification to .gitignore
#
# These credentials are used by browser verification to log into
# your application. The agent reads env var NAMES from config,
# then the browser tool reads VALUES from this file. The agent
# never sees the plaintext credentials.

# Test user credentials for browser verification
TEST_USER_EMAIL=
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=

# Optional: Additional auth-related variables
# TEST_USER_2FA_SECRET=
# TEST_API_KEY=
