Phase $1 is complete. Read EXECUTION_PLAN.md and run the checkpoint criteria.

## Automated Checks

Run these commands and report results:

1. **Tests**
   ```
   npm test
   ```
   (or equivalent test command from AGENTS.md)

2. **Type Checking**
   ```
   npm run typecheck
   ```
   (or equivalent, if applicable)

3. **Linting**
   ```
   npm run lint
   ```
   (or equivalent, if applicable)

4. **Security Scan**

   Run security checks:
   - Run dependency audit (npm audit, pip-audit, etc.)
   - Run secrets detection (grep for API keys, tokens, passwords)
   - Run static analysis for insecure patterns

   For CRITICAL or HIGH issues:
   - Present each issue with resolution options
   - Apply fixes based on user choices
   - Re-scan to confirm resolution

   Security scan blocks checkpoint if CRITICAL or HIGH issues remain unresolved.

## Manual Verification

From the "Phase $1 Checkpoint" section in EXECUTION_PLAN.md:
- List each manual verification item
- Indicate what I need to verify before proceeding

## Regression Check (if feature work)

- Confirm existing tests still pass
- Note any changes to existing functionality

## Report
