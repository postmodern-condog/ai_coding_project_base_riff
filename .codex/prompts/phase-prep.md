I want to execute Phase $1 from EXECUTION_PLAN.md. Before starting, read EXECUTION_PLAN.md and check:

## Pre-Flight Checks

1. **Pre-Phase Setup** — Check the "Pre-Phase Setup" section for Phase $1:
   - List any unmet prerequisites I need to complete
   - Identify environment variables or secrets needed
   - Note any external services that must be configured

2. **Dependencies** — Verify prior phases are complete:
   - Check that all tasks from previous phases have checked boxes
   - Flag any incomplete dependencies

3. **Permissions** — Review the tasks in Phase $1:
   - Identify any tools or permissions needed for autonomous execution
   - Check if any tasks require browser verification (Chrome DevTools MCP)

## Report

Provide a clear report:
- What's ready
- What's blocking (if anything)
- What I need to do before you can start Phase $1
