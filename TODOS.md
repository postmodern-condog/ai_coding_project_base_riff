## In Progress

- [ ] Intro commands for each Step
- [ ] Manual checks after each step, not each phase
- [ ] Verify that the Chrome DevTools integration works
- [ ] Add git worktrees support for parallel task execution
- [ ] TODOS handling

## Future Concepts

### Subagents (Claude Code only)

Add pre-built subagents in `.claude/agents/` for specialized tasks with isolated context:

| Subagent | Purpose | Tools |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `code-reviewer.md` | Review code and report issues (read-only) | Read, Grep, Glob |
| `security-auditor.md` | Scan for vulnerabilities | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash |
| `test-writer.md` | Generate tests for a file | Read, Write, Edit, Bash |
| `doc-generator.md` | Generate documentation | Read, Write, Glob |

**Why subagents instead of skills:**
- Context isolation — work doesn't pollute main agent's context
- Parallel execution — multiple subagents can work simultaneously
- Different tool permissions — e.g., read-only reviewer vs writer
- Self-contained tasks — returns result and is done

**Note:** Subagents are Claude Code-specific. Codex CLI does not support `.codex/agents/`.

### GitHub Actions Integration

Add `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` for automated CI/CD:

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic PR review against AGENTS.md standards
- Verify acceptance criteria from EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- Security scanning on pull requests
- Interactive mode responding to @claude mentions
- Scheduled maintenance (weekly audits, dependency checks)

**Setup:** Run `/install-github-app` in Claude Code terminal

**Example workflow:**
```yaml
name: Claude PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            Review this PR against @AGENTS.md standards.
            Check acceptance criteria in @EXECUTION_PLAN.md.
            Post findings as PR comments.
