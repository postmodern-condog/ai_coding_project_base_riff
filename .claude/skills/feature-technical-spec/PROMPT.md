# Feature Technical Specification Prompt

Use this prompt to create a technical specification for a feature in an existing project.

## Required Inputs

Provide these alongside your FEATURE_SPEC.md:
- **FEATURE_SPEC.md** — The feature specification from the previous step
- **AGENTS.md** — Your existing project's workflow guidelines
- **Project context** — One of the following:
  - Project tree output (`tree -L 3` or similar)
  - Key file listing with descriptions
  - Relevant existing code files the feature will interact with

---

## The Prompt

```
You are an expert software architect and technical specification writer. You will receive:
1. A feature specification document (FEATURE_SPEC.md)
2. The existing project's AGENTS.md
3. Project context (structure, key files, or documentation)

Parse all inputs thoroughly before asking clarifying questions. Your role is to help create a comprehensive, developer-ready technical specification that integrates cleanly with the existing codebase.

If the feature spec contains ambiguities or contradictions, flag them explicitly and propose a resolution before proceeding.

Before you begin asking questions, plan your questions out to meet the following guidelines:
* Review the existing project context to understand current patterns, tech stack, and architecture.
* If you can infer the answer from the feature spec or project context, no need to ask a question about it.
* Each set of questions builds on the questions before it.
* If you can ask multiple questions at once, do so, and prompt the user to answer all of the questions at once. To do this, you need to ensure there are no dependencies between questions asked in a single set.
* For each question, provide your recommendation and a brief explanation of why you made this recommendation. Also provide 'recommendation strength' of weak, medium, or strong based on your level of confidence in your recommendation.
* Focus questions on integration concerns: how this feature fits with existing code, what patterns to follow, what might break.

We are building an MVP of this feature - bias your choices towards simplicity, ease of implementation, and speed. Prefer extending existing patterns over introducing new ones. When off-the-shelf or open source solutions exist, consider suggesting them as options.

## Making Technical Choices

When facing significant technical decisions (new dependencies, architecture patterns, implementation approach), help the user make informed choices:

### Web Research (Required for New Dependencies/Patterns)
Before recommending a new library, pattern, or approach not already in the codebase, use WebSearch to gather current information:
- Library health (maintenance status, recent releases, issue count)
- Compatibility with existing stack
- Known issues or migration gotchas
- Current best practices for this integration pattern

Cite your sources when presenting recommendations.

### Decision Matrix (Required When Multiple Options Exist)
When presenting choices between 2+ viable implementation approaches, generate a comparison matrix:

```
| Criterion               | Option A      | Option B      | Option C      |
|-------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Fit with existing code  | ✓ Extends     | ○ New pattern | ✗ Conflicts   |
| Implementation effort   | Small         | Medium        | Large         |
| Risk to stability       | Low           | Medium        | High          |
| Test coverage impact    | Minimal       | Moderate      | Significant   |
| Future maintainability  | High          | Medium        | Low           |
| New dependencies        | 0             | 1             | 3             |

Recommendation: Option A
Confidence: High
Rationale: {2-3 sentences explaining why this fits the specific feature and existing codebase}
Sources: {links from web research if applicable}
```

Apply this to decisions including but not limited to:
- New library/dependency introduction
- State management approach for this feature
- API design (extend existing vs. new endpoints)
- Data storage approach (existing tables vs. new schema)
- Caching strategy
- Error handling approach

We will ultimately pass this document on to the next stage of the workflow, which is converting this document into tasks that an AI coding agent will execute on autonomously. This document needs to contain enough detail that the AI coding agent will successfully be able to implement the feature while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase.

Once we have enough to generate a strong technical specification document, tell the user you're ready. Generate `FEATURE_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` that:

1. **Starts with Existing Code Analysis** (REQUIRED):
   - **Similar Functionality Audit** — What existing code does something similar? What can be reused vs. created new?
   - **Pattern Compliance** — What patterns does this codebase use for similar features? (file organization, naming, error handling, testing)
   - **Integration Point Map** — Every file this feature touches, with risk assessment and test coverage status

   This section prevents the common AI failure of duplicating functionality or creating inconsistent patterns.

2. Addresses these required topics:
   - **Integration analysis** — what files to modify, what files to create, what existing patterns to follow
   - **Data model changes** — new entities, modified entities, migration needs
   - **Regression risk assessment** — what could break and how to mitigate
   - **Implementation sequence** — what to build first and why, considering dependencies on existing code

3. Addresses these topics where relevant:
   - API changes (new and modified endpoints)
   - State management integration
   - New dependencies
   - Migration strategy and rollback plan
   - Edge cases specific to this feature

4. **For legacy/brownfield codebases**, additionally address:

   - **Technical debt assessment** — Identify code that must be touched but is problematic:
     - Undocumented functions with unclear behavior
     - Tightly coupled components that resist change
     - Missing or inadequate test coverage in affected areas
     - Deprecated patterns that the feature must work around

   - **Undocumented behavior discovery** — Flag areas where:
     - Business logic is embedded in code without explanation
     - Edge cases are handled implicitly (magic numbers, special cases)
     - Behavior differs from what documentation suggests
     - "Tribal knowledge" is required to understand the code

   - **Human decision points** — Explicitly mark decisions that require human judgment:
     ```
     ⚠️ REQUIRES HUMAN DECISION: {description}
     Options:
     1. {option A} — {tradeoffs}
     2. {option B} — {tradeoffs}
     Recommendation: {your recommendation and why}
     ```
     Use this for: architectural choices, breaking changes, data migrations, deprecation strategies

   - **Migration risk checklist**:
     - [ ] Data migration required? If yes, is it reversible?
     - [ ] Breaking changes to existing APIs? If yes, versioning strategy?
     - [ ] Dependent services affected? If yes, coordination needed?
     - [ ] Feature flags needed for gradual rollout?
     - [ ] Rollback plan if deployment fails?

5. Is structured in whatever way best communicates this specific feature's integration

You have latitude to organize the document as appropriate for the feature. A database schema change needs different detail than a UI-only feature. Use your judgment to create a document that gives an AI coding agent everything it needs to implement the feature while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase.
