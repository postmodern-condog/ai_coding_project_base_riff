Initialize a new project at `$1` with the AI Coding Toolkit.

## Steps

0. **Directory guard (must run from toolkit repo)**
   - Confirm `START_PROMPTS.md` and `GENERATOR_PROMPT.md` exist in the current working directory
   - If either is missing, **STOP** and tell the user to `cd` into the `ai_coding_project_base` toolkit repo and re-run `/setup $1`

0.5. **Idempotency Check**

   Check if target already has toolkit installed:

   ```bash
   if [[ -f "$1/.claude/toolkit-version.json" ]]; then
     EXISTING_COMMIT=$(jq -r '.toolkit_commit' "$1/.claude/toolkit-version.json")
     CURRENT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   fi
   ```

   Decision logic:
   - If `toolkit-version.json` doesn't exist → proceed with **full setup** (existing flow)
   - If exists and `toolkit_commit` = current HEAD → report "Already up to date" and skip to Step 7 (success report)
   - If exists and `toolkit_commit` ≠ current HEAD → proceed with **incremental update** (Step 3a)

   Store the result as `SETUP_MODE`:
   - `SETUP_MODE=full` — new installation
   - `SETUP_MODE=current` — already up to date
   - `SETUP_MODE=incremental` — updating existing installation

1. **Validate target directory**
   - If `$1` is empty, ask the user for the target directory path
   - Check if the directory exists; if not, offer to create it

2. **Ask project type**
   - Greenfield: Starting a new project from scratch
   - Feature: Adding a feature to an existing project

2a. **For Feature type: Ask feature name and create directory**
    - Prompt: "What should this feature be called? (used as folder name, e.g., 'analytics-dashboard')"
    - Validate: lowercase, hyphens and underscores allowed, no spaces or special characters
    - Create `$1/features/` directory if it doesn't exist
    - Create `$1/features/<feature-name>/` directory
    - Store the feature path as `FEATURE_PATH` = `$1/features/<feature-name>`

3. **Copy skills to target**

   Copy all skills to the target's `.claude/skills/`:
   - `.claude/skills/` → target's `.claude/skills/`

   Copy verification config (if missing):
   - `.claude/verification-config.json` → target's `.claude/verification-config.json`

3a. **Incremental Sync (When SETUP_MODE=incremental)**

   Skip Step 3 entirely and use this incremental approach instead:

   Load the stored file hashes from `$1/.claude/toolkit-version.json`:
   ```bash
   STORED_HASHES=$(jq '.files' "$1/.claude/toolkit-version.json")
   ```

   For each skill in the copy list:

   1. Calculate toolkit file hash:
      ```bash
      TOOLKIT_HASH=$(shasum -a 256 "$TOOLKIT_FILE" | cut -d' ' -f1)
      ```

   2. Get stored hash from toolkit-version.json (hash at last sync)

   3. Calculate target file hash (if exists):
      ```bash
      TARGET_HASH=$(shasum -a 256 "$TARGET_FILE" | cut -d' ' -f1)
      ```

   **Classification and Action:**

   | Condition | Classification | Action |
   |-----------|----------------|--------|
   | Target doesn't exist | `NEW` | Copy from toolkit |
   | Target hash = Toolkit hash | `CURRENT` | Skip (already up to date) |
   | Target hash = Stored hash | `CLEAN_UPDATE` | Copy from toolkit (no local changes) |
   | Target hash ≠ Stored hash | `LOCAL_MODIFIED` | Skip with warning |

   Track counts for each classification and report summary:
   ```
   INCREMENTAL SYNC
   ================
   New files:      {count} copied
   Updated files:  {count} copied
   Current files:  {count} skipped (already up to date)
   Modified files: {count} skipped (local changes preserved)
   ```

   If any files are `LOCAL_MODIFIED`, list them:
   ```
   WARNING: These files have local modifications and were NOT updated:
   - .claude/skills/phase-start/SKILL.md
   - .claude/skills/fresh-start/SKILL.md

   To update these files, either:
   - Run /sync for interactive conflict resolution
   - Manually backup and delete them, then re-run /setup
   ```

4. **Create or Update toolkit-version.json**

   **For full setup (SETUP_MODE=full):**

   Create `.claude/toolkit-version.json` in the target to enable future syncs:

   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": "1.0",
     "toolkit_location": "{absolute path to this toolkit}",
     "toolkit_commit": "{current git HEAD commit hash}",
     "toolkit_commit_date": "{commit date in ISO format}",
     "last_sync": "{current ISO timestamp}",
     "files": {
       ".claude/skills/fresh-start/SKILL.md": {
         "hash": "{sha256 hash of copied file}",
         "synced_at": "{ISO timestamp}"
       }
       // ... entry for each copied skill
     }
   }
   ```

   **For incremental update (SETUP_MODE=incremental):**

   Update the existing `toolkit-version.json`:
   - Update `toolkit_commit` to current HEAD
   - Update `toolkit_commit_date` to current commit date
   - Update `last_sync` to current timestamp
   - For each file that was copied (NEW or CLEAN_UPDATE):
     - Update the file's `hash` and `synced_at`
   - Keep existing entries for files that were skipped (CURRENT or LOCAL_MODIFIED)

   **For already current (SETUP_MODE=current):**

   Skip this step entirely.

   **Get toolkit info:**
   ```bash
   TOOLKIT_PATH=$(pwd)
   COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   COMMIT_DATE=$(git log -1 --format=%cI HEAD)
   ```

   **Calculate file hashes:**
   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 "$file" | cut -d' ' -f1
   ```

   **Include entries for ALL files in skill directories:**
   ```bash
   # Hash every .md file in every skill directory
   for skill_dir in .claude/skills/*/; do
     for file in "$skill_dir"*.md; do
       [[ -f "$file" ]] || continue
       hash=$(shasum -a 256 "$file" | cut -d' ' -f1)
       # Add entry for "$file" with hash and timestamp
     done
   done
   ```

   This ensures skills with supporting files (e.g., `audit-skills/CRITERIA.md`,
   `audit-skills/SCORING.md`) are tracked for conflict detection.

   **Do NOT copy:**
   - Generation skills (setup, product-spec, etc.) — these run from the toolkit
   - Prompt files — these stay in the toolkit

5. **Create CLAUDE.md if it doesn't exist**

   Create a minimal CLAUDE.md that references AGENTS.md:
   ```
   @AGENTS.md
   ```

6. **Codex CLI Detection (Optional)**

   Check if OpenAI Codex CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1
   ```

   If Codex is detected:
   - Use AskUserQuestion to prompt:
     ```
     Question: "Codex CLI detected. Install toolkit skills for Codex?"
     Options:
       - "Yes, install" — Install skills via symlink (auto-updates with toolkit)
       - "No, skip" — Don't install Codex skills
     ```

   If user selects "Yes, install":
   - Run from this toolkit directory:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/install-codex-skill-pack.sh --method symlink
     ```
   - Report the installation result

   If Codex is not detected:
   - Skip silently (don't mention Codex to users who don't have it)

   **Note:** Using symlinks means Codex skills auto-update when user runs `git pull` on the toolkit.

6a. **Codex MCP Configuration (if Codex detected and skills installed)**

   After installing Codex skills, offer to configure essential MCPs:
   - Use AskUserQuestion to prompt:
     ```
     Question: "Configure essential MCP servers for Codex? (Playwright for browser verification)"
     Options:
       - "Yes, configure" — Add Playwright MCP to ~/.codex/config.toml
       - "No, skip" — Skip MCP configuration
     ```

   If user selects "Yes, configure":
   - Run from this toolkit directory:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/configure-codex-mcp.sh
     ```
   - Report the configuration result

   **Why this matters:** Both Claude Code and Codex CLI support the same MCP protocol.
   This ensures Codex has access to browser automation for verification workflows,
   matching Claude Code's capabilities when using the Playwright MCP.

7. **Report success and next steps**

   **For SETUP_MODE=current (already up to date):**
   ```
   ALREADY UP TO DATE
   ==================
   Target: $1
   Toolkit commit: {COMMIT_HASH} ({COMMIT_DATE})

   No changes needed — toolkit files are current.
   ```

   **For SETUP_MODE=incremental (updated existing):**
   ```
   TOOLKIT UPDATED
   ===============
   Target: $1
   Previous commit: {OLD_COMMIT_HASH}
   Current commit:  {COMMIT_HASH}

   {Summary from Step 3a showing files synced/skipped}

   All toolkit skills are now up to date.
   ```

   **For SETUP_MODE=full, Greenfield:**
   ```
   TOOLKIT INITIALIZED
   ===================
   Target: $1

   Next steps (run from THIS toolkit directory):
   1. /product-spec $1
   2. /technical-spec $1
   3. /generate-plan $1

   Then switch to your project:
   4. cd $1
   5. /fresh-start
   6. /configure-verification
   7. /phase-prep 1
   8. /phase-start 1
   ```

   **For SETUP_MODE=full, Feature:**
   ```
   TOOLKIT INITIALIZED
   ===================
   Target: $1
   Feature directory: FEATURE_PATH

   Next steps (run from THIS toolkit directory):
   1. /feature-spec FEATURE_PATH
   2. /feature-technical-spec FEATURE_PATH
   3. /feature-plan FEATURE_PATH

   Then switch to your feature directory:
   4. cd FEATURE_PATH
   5. /fresh-start
   6. /configure-verification
   7. /phase-prep 1
   8. /phase-start 1

   After phase completion, merge AGENTS_ADDITIONS.md into $1/AGENTS.md
   ```

## Important

- This skill must be run from the ai_coding_project_base toolkit directory
- Generation skills run from toolkit, execution skills run from target
- Use `cp -r` for directory copies to preserve structure
- Do not overwrite existing files without asking

## When Setup Cannot Complete

**If LOCAL_MODIFIED files conflict during incremental sync:**
- List all conflicting files with their local vs toolkit versions
- Ask user: "Keep local changes, overwrite with toolkit, or diff each file?"
- If "Keep local": Skip those files, complete rest of sync, warn about version mismatch
- If "Overwrite": Back up local files to `.claude/backup/` before overwriting
- If "Diff each": Show side-by-side diff, let user choose per file

**If target directory doesn't exist and can't be created:**
- Report: "Cannot create directory: {path}"
- Check parent directory permissions
- Suggest: Create manually with `mkdir -p {path}`
- Exit cleanly without partial state

**If Codex CLI skill installation fails:**
- Do NOT fail the entire setup
- Report: "Codex skill installation failed: {error}"
- Continue with rest of setup
- Note at end: "Codex skills not installed. Run `./scripts/install-codex-skill-pack.sh` manually."

**If toolkit-version.json cannot be written:**
- Report: "Cannot write toolkit-version.json"
- Complete the file copies (primary goal)
- Warn: "Future incremental syncs will not work until version file is created"
- Suggest: Check .claude/ directory permissions
