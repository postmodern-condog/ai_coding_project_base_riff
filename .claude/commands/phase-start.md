Execute all steps and tasks in Phase $1 from EXECUTION_PLAN.md.

## Context Detection

Determine working context:

1. If current working directory matches pattern `*/features/*`:
   - PROJECT_ROOT = parent of parent of CWD (e.g., `/project/features/foo` → `/project`)
   - MODE = "feature"

2. Otherwise:
   - PROJECT_ROOT = current working directory
   - MODE = "greenfield"

## Context

Before starting, read these files:
- **PROJECT_ROOT/AGENTS.md** — Follow all workflow conventions
- **EXECUTION_PLAN.md** — Task definitions and acceptance criteria (from CWD)

## Directory Guard (Wrong Directory Check)

Before starting, confirm the required files exist:
- `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` exists in the current working directory
- `PROJECT_ROOT/AGENTS.md` exists

- If either is missing, **STOP** and tell the user to `cd` into their project/feature directory (the one containing `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`) and re-run `/phase-start $1`.

## Execution Rules

1. **Git Workflow (Auto-Commit)**

   **One branch per phase, one commit per task:**
   ```
   main
     └── phase-$1 (branch)
           ├── task(1.1.A): Add user model       ← step 1.1
           ├── task(1.1.B): Add user routes
           ├── task(1.1.C): Add user tests
           ├── task(1.2.A): Add auth middleware   ← step 1.2 continues
           ├── task(1.2.B): Add login endpoint
           └── task(1.3.A): Add session handling  ← step 1.3 continues
   ```

   Before starting the phase (once, at the beginning):
   ```bash
   # Commit any dirty files first (preserves user work)
   git add -A && git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "wip: uncommitted changes before phase-$1"
   ```

   **Check for unpushed commits before branching:**
   ```bash
   # Get current branch and check if ahead of remote
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   UNPUSHED=$(git rev-list --count @{upstream}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "no-upstream")
   ```

   - If `UNPUSHED` is a number > 0:
     - Ask: "You have {UNPUSHED} unpushed commit(s) on `{CURRENT_BRANCH}`. Push before creating phase branch? (recommended)"
     - If yes: `git push`
     - If no: Continue (user accepts branching from unpushed state)
   - If `UNPUSHED` is "no-upstream" or 0: Continue without prompting

   ```bash
   # Create phase branch from current HEAD
   git checkout -b phase-$1
   ```

   After each task completion (sequential commits on same branch):
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "task({id}): {description}"
   ```

   **Do NOT push.** Leave pushing to the human after manual verification at checkpoint.

   **Commit discipline:**
   - Every task gets its own commit immediately after verification passes
   - All commits are sequential on the phase branch—each builds on the previous
   - Steps are logical groupings, not separate branches
   - Never batch multiple tasks into one commit
   - Include task ID in commit message for traceability
   - Use conventional commit format: `task({id}): {imperative description}`

2. **Task Execution** (for each task)
   - Read the task definition and acceptance criteria
   - **Explore before implementing:**
     - Search for similar existing functionality (don't duplicate)
     - Identify patterns used elsewhere in codebase
     - List reusable utilities/components to leverage
     - Note conventions (naming, error handling, structure)
   - Write tests first (one per acceptance criterion)
   - Implement minimum code to pass tests, following discovered patterns
   - Run verification using /verify-task
   - Update checkboxes in EXECUTION_PLAN.md: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - **Commit immediately** (see Git Workflow above)

3. **Stuck Detection and Recovery**

   Track consecutive failures. If ANY of these occur, **STOP and escalate to human**:

   | Trigger | Threshold | Action |
   |---------|-----------|--------|
   | Consecutive task failures | 3 tasks | Pause phase |
   | Same error pattern | 2 occurrences | Pause and report pattern |
   | Verification loop | 5 attempts on same criterion | Mark task blocked |
   | Test flakiness | Same test passes then fails | Flag for review |

   **When stuck, report:**
   ```
   STUCK: Phase $1, Task {id}
   ─────────────────────────────
   Pattern: {describe what keeps failing}
   Attempts: {N}

   Last 3 errors:
   1. {error summary}
   2. {error summary}
   3. {error summary}

   Possible causes:
   - {hypothesis 1}
   - {hypothesis 2}

   Options:
   1. Skip this task and continue
   2. Modify acceptance criteria
   3. Take a different approach: {suggestion}
   4. Abort phase for manual intervention
   ```

   **Do not:**
   - Keep retrying the same approach
   - Silently skip failing tasks
   - Reduce test coverage to make things pass

4. **Blocking Issues**
   - If blocked, report using the format in AGENTS.md
   - Do not continue past a blocker without resolution

5. **Context Hygiene**
   - Summarize progress between steps if context grows large

## State Tracking

Maintain `.claude/phase-state.json` throughout execution:

1. **At phase start**, update state:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude
   ```

   Set phase status to `IN_PROGRESS` with `started_at` timestamp.

2. **After each task completion**, update the task entry:
   ```json
   {
     "tasks": {
       "{task_id}": {
         "status": "COMPLETE",
         "completed_at": "{ISO timestamp}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **If task is blocked**, record the blocker:
   ```json
   {
     "tasks": {
       "{task_id}": {
         "status": "BLOCKED",
         "blocker": "{description}",
         "blocker_type": "user-action|dependency|external-service|unclear-requirements",
         "since": "{ISO timestamp}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **State file format** (create if missing):
   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": "1.0",
     "project_name": "{directory name}",
     "last_updated": "{ISO timestamp}",
     "main": {
       "current_phase": 1,
       "total_phases": 6,
       "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
       "phases": [
         {
           "number": 1,
           "name": "{Phase Name}",
           "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
           "started_at": "{ISO timestamp}",
           "tasks": {}
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

If `.claude/phase-state.json` doesn't exist, run `/populate-state` first to initialize it.

## Completion

Do not check back until Phase $1 is complete, unless blocked or stuck.

When done, provide:
- Summary of what was built
- Files created/modified
- Git branch and commits created
- Any issues encountered
- Ready for /phase-checkpoint $1

**Note:** Branches are not pushed automatically. After `/phase-checkpoint` passes, the human will review and push.
