Analyze the TODO items in TODOS.md and produce a prioritized list with implementation guidance.

## Directory Guard (Wrong Directory Check)

Before starting:
- If the current directory appears to be the toolkit repo (e.g., `GENERATOR_PROMPT.md` exists), **STOP** and tell the user to run `/list-todos` from their project directory instead.
- Confirm `TODOS.md` exists in the current working directory. If it does not exist, **STOP** and ask the user where their project TODOs live.

## Process

1. **Read TODOS.md** from the project root
2. **Read project context** — Scan PRODUCT_SPEC.md, TECHNICAL_SPEC.md, AGENTS.md, and EXECUTION_PLAN.md if they exist
3. **Extract TODO items** — Parse all actionable items from TODOS.md
4. **Analyze each item** using the framework below
5. **Sort by priority score** (highest first), break ties by value to project
6. **Output the prioritized list**

## Analysis Framework

For each TODO item, evaluate:

### Ranking Factors

| Factor | Low | Medium | High |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| **Requirements Clarity** | One-liner with no context, unclear intent | Some details but gaps remain | Detailed spec with acceptance criteria |
| **Ease of Implementation** | Can't assess without clearer requirements | Moderate effort, approach is clear | Straightforward, clear path |
| **Value to Project** | Can't assess without clearer requirements | Useful improvement | Core functionality, high impact |

### Critical Rule: Do NOT Infer

**If requirements clarity is LOW, do NOT attempt to infer what the item means.**

- Do NOT guess the implementation approach
- Do NOT assume what problem it solves
- Set Ease and Value to "Cannot assess"
- Focus Open Questions on understanding the basic intent

A one-liner TODO like "Add feature X" with no additional context = LOW clarity, regardless of how obvious it might seem.

### Priority Score Calculation

```
Priority = (Clarity + Ease + Value) / 3 × 10
```

Where each factor is scored 1-3 (Low=1, Medium=2, High=3), producing a 1-10 scale.

**If Clarity is LOW, cap the Priority Score at 3/10 maximum.**

Adjust score based on:
- **Boost (+1-2):** Blocks other work, security-related, frequently requested
- **Reduce (-1-2):** Speculative, already has workaround, external dependency

## Output Format

### For items with HIGH or MEDIUM requirements clarity:

```markdown
## {N}. {TODO Title}

**Priority Score:** {N}/10
**Ranking Factors:**
- Requirements Clarity: {Medium|High} — {one sentence explanation}
- Ease of Implementation: {Low|Medium|High} — {one sentence explanation}
- Value to Project: {Low|Medium|High} — {one sentence explanation}

**Implementation Notes:**
{2-4 sentences on how to implement: key files to modify, approach, dependencies, estimated scope}

**Open Questions:**
- {Question that would improve requirements clarity}
- {Another question, if applicable}

**Suggested Next Action:** {One of: "Ready to implement", "Needs research", "Consider deferring", "Consider removing"}
```

### For items with LOW requirements clarity:

```markdown
## {N}. {TODO Title}

**Priority Score:** {N}/10 (capped due to unclear requirements)
**Ranking Factors:**
- Requirements Clarity: **Low** — {explain what's missing: no context, unclear intent, etc.}
- Ease of Implementation: Cannot assess
- Value to Project: Cannot assess

**What I understand:** {Brief statement of what little is clear, or "Only the title"}

**What I don't understand:**
- {Specific gap in understanding}
- {Another gap}

**Questions to clarify before proceeding:**
1. {Fundamental question about intent/purpose}
2. {Question about scope}
3. {Question about expected behavior}

**Suggested Next Action:** Clarify requirements first
```

### Summary section:

```markdown
# TODOS Analysis

**Generated:** {date}
**Items Analyzed:** {count}
**Project:** {project name from specs, or directory name}

---

{Individual item analyses, sorted by priority score}

---

## Summary

| Priority | Item | Score | Next Action |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | {title} | {N}/10 | {action} |
| 2 | {title} | {N}/10 | {action} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Ready to implement:** {count}
**Needs clarification:** {count}
**Consider deferring:** {count}
```

## Notes

- If TODOS.md doesn't exist, report: "No TODOS.md found in project root."
- Skip items that are clearly completed (checked boxes)
- Group related items if they should be tackled together
- Consider project phase — items relevant to current phase score higher

---

## Interactive Q&A Phase

After displaying the prioritized list and summary, offer the user an interactive session to clarify requirements.

### Step 1: Offer to Start Q&A

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask:

```
Question: "Would you like to clarify requirements for any items?"
Header: "Q&A Mode"
Options:
  - Label: "Yes, let's clarify"
    Description: "I'll ask questions about specific items to improve their requirements"
  - Label: "No, I'm done"
    Description: "Exit without further clarification"
```

If the user selects "No", end the command.

### Step 2: Select Item to Clarify

If the user selects "Yes", use AskUserQuestion to let them pick an item:

```
Question: "Which item would you like to clarify? (Enter the priority number)"
Header: "Select Item"
Options:
  - Label: "1. {first item title}"
    Description: "Score: {N}/10 — {next action}"
  - Label: "2. {second item title}"
    Description: "Score: {N}/10 — {next action}"
  - Label: "3. {third item title}"
    Description: "Score: {N}/10 — {next action}"
  - Label: "4. {fourth item title}"
    Description: "Score: {N}/10 — {next action}"
```

Note: Only show up to 4 items per question (tool limit). If more items exist, include "Other" option for the user to type a number.

### Step 3: Ask Open Questions One at a Time

For the selected item, ask each open question individually using AskUserQuestion:

```
Question: "{The open question from the analysis}"
Header: "{Item title (truncated)}"
Options:
  - Label: "{Claude's recommended answer}"
    Description: "(Recommended) {Brief rationale for this recommendation}"
  - Label: "{Alternative answer 1}"
    Description: "{Why someone might choose this}"
  - Label: "{Alternative answer 2}"
    Description: "{Why someone might choose this}"
```

**Important guidelines for questions:**
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Always provide Claude's recommendation as the FIRST option with "(Recommended)" in the description
- Provide 2-3 reasonable alternatives as other options
- The user can always select "Other" to provide a custom answer
- Wait for each answer before asking the next question

### Step 4: Update TODOS.md with Clarifications

After all questions for an item are answered, update TODOS.md:

1. Find the item's section in TODOS.md
2. Add a new subsection or update the existing description with the clarifications
3. Format the clarifications clearly:

```markdown
### {Item Title}

{Original description}

**Clarifications (from Q&A {date}):**
- {Question 1}: {Answer 1}
- {Question 2}: {Answer 2}
- {Question 3}: {Answer 3}
```

Use the Edit tool to make these updates.

### Step 5: Continue or Exit

After updating TODOS.md, use AskUserQuestion to ask:

```
Question: "Item updated. Would you like to clarify another item?"
Header: "Continue?"
Options:
  - Label: "Yes, continue"
    Description: "Select another item to clarify"
  - Label: "No, I'm done"
    Description: "Exit Q&A mode"
```

If "Yes", return to Step 2. If "No", display a summary of items clarified and exit.

### Exit Summary

When exiting Q&A mode, output:

```markdown
## Q&A Session Complete

**Items clarified:** {count}
{List of items that were clarified with brief summary of decisions made}

TODOS.md has been updated with the clarifications above.
```
