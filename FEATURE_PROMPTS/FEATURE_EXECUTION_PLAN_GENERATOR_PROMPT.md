# Feature Execution Plan Generator Prompt

Use this prompt to generate an execution plan for implementing a **new feature** in an **existing project**:
- **EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Detailed phase/step/task breakdown for the feature
- **AGENTS.md additions** - Suggested workflow additions if the feature requires capabilities not in your current AGENTS.md

This prompt requires your existing `AGENTS.md` file as input to ensure compatibility and identify any workflow gaps.

---

## The Prompt

```
I need you to generate an execution plan for implementing a new feature in my existing project.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 1: EXECUTION HIERARCHY DEFINITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PHASE**: A major milestone with a human checkpoint at the end
- Represents significant, demonstrable functionality
- Ends with manual testing and human approval
- Includes pre-phase setup requirements (external services, env vars, etc.)

**STEP**: A completion boundary containing sequential work
- Groups related tasks that should be completed together
- All tasks in a step must complete before the next step begins
- Has clear dependencies on prior steps

**TASK**: An atomic unit of work for a single AI agent session
- Has specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Creates or modifies a focused set of files
- Independent from parallel tasks in the same step

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 3: ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating the execution plan:

1. **Review existing AGENTS.md**
   - Understand the current workflow (task execution steps, context management)
   - Note what verification methods are defined (testing policy, manual checks)
   - Identify any gaps: Does the feature need workflow elements not currently defined?
   - Common gaps to check for:
     - Browser/UI verification workflows
     - Regression testing requirements
     - Database migration procedures
     - External service integration patterns

2. **Understand the existing project**
   - Review the project structure and architecture
   - Identify relevant existing patterns (error handling, state management, API design)
   - Note testing conventions and frameworks in use
   - Understand the deployment model

3. **Map integration points**
   - Which existing files need modification?
   - Which existing components will the feature interact with?
   - Are there shared utilities, hooks, or services to reuse?
   - What interfaces or types already exist that apply?

4. **Identify risks and dependencies**
   - Could this feature break existing functionality?
   - Are there migration concerns (database, config, etc.)?
   - Does this require new external services or dependencies?

5. **Plan the phases**
   - Phase 1 is typically foundation/infrastructure for the feature
   - Middle phases build core functionality incrementally
   - Final phase handles polish, edge cases, and cleanup

6. **Ensure backward compatibility**
   - Existing tests must continue to pass
   - Public APIs should not break (or require migration path)
   - Consider feature flags if incremental rollout is needed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 4: TASK QUALITY CHECKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For each task, verify:

✓ Has 3-6 specific, testable acceptance criteria
✓ Lists concrete files to create/modify
✓ References existing code to follow as patterns
✓ Specifies dependencies on prior tasks
✓ References relevant feature spec section
✓ Is independent from parallel tasks in same step
✓ Considers impact on existing functionality

Red flags to fix:
✗ Vague criteria like "works correctly" or "handles errors properly"
✗ Too many files (>7) touched in one task
✗ Dependencies on parallel tasks in the same step
✗ Missing spec reference
✗ No consideration of existing code patterns
✗ Changes to existing files without clear rationale

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 5: FEATURE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When planning feature work, explicitly address:

**Data Layer Changes**
- New database tables/columns needed?
- Migrations required?
- Changes to existing data models?

**API Changes**
- New endpoints?
- Modifications to existing endpoints?
- Versioning considerations?

**UI Changes**
- New components?
- Modifications to existing components?
- Routing changes?

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for new code
- Integration tests for feature flows
- Regression tests for modified existing code

**Rollback Plan**
- Can the feature be disabled without deployment?
- Are database changes reversible?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INPUTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Existing AGENTS.md (Required)

{Paste or attach your current AGENTS.md file. This is required to:}
- Ensure the execution plan uses compatible workflow patterns
- Identify gaps that need new workflow additions
- Maintain consistency with your established conventions

---

## Current Project Context

{Provide one or more of the following:}

### Option A: Key Files
- Project structure (tree output or key directories)
- README.md or project documentation
- Relevant existing code files the feature will interact with

### Option B: Summary Description
If you can't provide files, describe:
- Tech stack (language, framework, database, etc.)
- Architecture pattern (monolith, microservices, etc.)
- Key components the feature will touch
- Testing approach (Jest, Pytest, etc.)

---

## Feature Specification Documents (Required)

{Paste or attach both documents from the previous workflow steps:}

### FEATURE_SPEC.md
- What the feature does (user-facing behavior)
- Target users and core user experience
- Integration points with existing functionality
- Scope boundaries

### FEATURE_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Data model changes and migration strategy
- API contracts (new and modified endpoints)
- Files to create and modify
- Regression risk assessment

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 6: AGENTS.md ADDITIONS FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If the feature requires workflow elements not present in the existing AGENTS.md,
output suggested additions in this format:

## Suggested AGENTS.md Additions

### Reason for additions
{Brief explanation of why these additions are needed for this feature}

### New sections to add

#### {Section Name}
```
{Content to add to AGENTS.md}
```

**Where to add:** {After which existing section}

---

Common additions to consider:

**Git Branch Strategy** — If not already defined in AGENTS.md
```
## Git Conventions

### Branch Strategy

Create one branch per **phase** (not per step or task):

git checkout -b phase-{N}
# Example: git checkout -b phase-1

**Branch lifecycle:**
1. Create branch from main/develop before starting first task in phase
2. Commit after each task completion (all tasks sequential on same branch)
3. Do not push until human reviews at checkpoint
4. Create PR for review at phase checkpoint
5. Merge after checkpoint approval

### Commit Format

task({id}): {description}
# Example: task(1.2.A): Add user authentication endpoint

### Branch and Commit Structure

| Item | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Phase branch | `phase-{N}` | `phase-1` |
| Commit | `task({id}): {description}` | `task(1.2.A): Add login form` |

Steps are logical groupings within the branch—not separate branches.
```

**Code Verification Workflow** — Recommended for all features
```
## Verification

After implementing each task, verify all acceptance criteria are met.

### Primary: Code Verification Skill (Claude Code)

If using Claude Code with the code-verification skill available:

Use /code-verification to verify this task against its acceptance criteria

The skill will:
- Parse each acceptance criterion
- Spawn sub-agents to verify each one
- Attempt fixes (up to 5 times) for failures
- Generate a verification report

### Fallback: Manual Verification Checklist

If the code-verification skill is not available, manually verify:

1. **Run tests** — `npm test` (or equivalent)
2. **Type check** — `npm run typecheck` (or equivalent)
3. **Lint** — `npm run lint` (or equivalent)
4. **Manual check** — For each acceptance criterion:
   - Read the criterion
   - Verify it is met (inspect code, run app, check output)
   - If not met, fix and re-verify
5. **Document** — Note verification status in completion report
```

**Checkbox Update Format** — If not already defined in AGENTS.md
```
## Progress Tracking

When completing acceptance criteria, update EXECUTION_PLAN.md checkboxes:

# Before
- [ ] User can log in with email and password

# After
- [x] User can log in with email and password
```

**Browser Verification Workflow** — If feature has UI acceptance criteria
```
## Browser Verification

For tasks marked "Requires Browser Verification: Yes":
1. Start dev server if not running
2. Navigate to relevant pages
3. Verify each UI acceptance criterion visually
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Capture screenshots for visual changes
```

**Regression Testing Policy** — If feature modifies existing functionality
```
## Regression Testing

When modifying existing code:
- Run full test suite, not just new tests
- Verify existing functionality still works
- Document any intentional behavior changes
```

**Database Migration Workflow** — If feature includes schema changes
```
## Database Migrations

For tasks involving database changes:
1. Write migration before implementation code
2. Test migration up AND down
3. Verify existing data is preserved
4. Document rollback procedure
```

**Follow-Up Items Workflow** — Always include this section
```
## Follow-Up Items (TODOS.md)

During development, you will discover items outside current task scope: refactoring opportunities, edge cases, documentation needs, technical debt, etc.

**When you identify a follow-up item:**

1. **Prompt the human to start TODOS.md** if it doesn't exist:
   I've identified a follow-up item: {description}
   Should I create TODOS.md to track this and future items?

2. **Add items to TODOS.md** with context:
   ## TODO: {Brief title}
   - **Source:** Task {id} or {file:line}
   - **Description:** {What needs to be done}
   - **Priority:** {Suggested: High/Medium/Low}
   - **Added:** {Date}

3. **Prompt for prioritization** when the list grows or at phase checkpoints:
   TODOS.md now has {N} items. Would you like to:
   - Review and prioritize them?
   - Add any to the current phase?
   - Defer to a future phase?

Do not silently ignore discovered issues. Do not scope-creep by fixing them without approval. Track them in TODOS.md and let the human decide.
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Generate:
1. EXECUTION_PLAN.md
2. Suggested AGENTS.md additions (if needed)

Note: The execution plan references FEATURE_SPEC.md and FEATURE_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
(your feature specification documents) instead of PRODUCT_SPEC.md and TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
for context management purposes.
```

---

## Follow-Up Prompts

### To refine specific tasks:
```
Review Task {X.Y.Z} and improve:
1. Make acceptance criteria more specific and testable
2. Clarify which existing files need modification
3. Identify patterns from existing code to follow
4. Check dependencies are accurate
```

### To handle discovered complexity:
```
While exploring the codebase, I found {discovery}.

Update the execution plan to account for this:
1. Adjust affected tasks
2. Add new tasks if needed
3. Update dependencies
```

### To add incremental scope:
```
We need to also support {additional requirement}.

Update EXECUTION_PLAN.md to include this:
1. Determine which phase it belongs in
2. Create new tasks or modify existing ones
3. Update dependencies
```

### To handle breaking changes:
```
This feature requires breaking changes to {component}.

Add a migration phase that:
1. Documents the breaking change
2. Provides migration path for existing code
3. Updates affected tests
```

- [ ] Foreign key constraint links to existing users table
- [ ] Index exists on user_id + created_at for efficient queries
- [ ] Migration runs successfully (up and down)

**Files to Create:**
- `src/lib/db/migrations/003_notifications.sql` — migration file

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — add Notification type

**Existing Code to Reference:**
- `src/lib/db/migrations/001_users.sql` — follow migration patterns
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — follow type definition patterns

**Dependencies:** None

**Spec Reference:** Feature Spec > Data Model

**Requires Browser Verification:** No
